This project describes a simple general purpose language to test out some of my ideas around structural types and seeing
how that would work.  The unification algorithm in itself needs to be worked out.
  

## Features

The features that I would like to be included in this language are:

- Native data types: Char, Int, String, Float, Unit and functions
- Type constraints through type signatures
- Object based where an object is a collection of named values
- No null values and no exceptions
- No inheritance but object composition using delegation
- No modules for now
